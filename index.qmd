# Welcome to the Jacobs Research Network

Our goal is to improve science communication about people who are disadvantaged in our societies, such as those living in poverty or adversity. To convey the diverse knowledge, perspectives, values, strengths, and strategies they have to offer.

We are a group of mainly early-career scientists. We have diverse backgrounds and identities.

We aspire for synergy with anyone who shares our mission, including journalists, policy makers, and other stakeholders. If youâ€™re interested, feel free to reach out!
