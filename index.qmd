# Welcome to the Jacobs Research Network

We aim to improve science communication about people who experience social, economic, and other forms of adversity. Our goal is to adopt a humanizing and holistic approach that recognizes and highlights the unique knowledge and strengths of people who are systematically disadvantaged in our societies.

We are a group of scientists across the world at different career stages who come from diverse backgrounds and hold unique identities.We are a group of mainly early-career scientists. We have diverse backgrounds and identities.

We aspire for synergy with anyone who shares our mission, including journalists, policy makers, and other stakeholders. If you\'re interested, feel free to reach out!
