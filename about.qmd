We are a group of mainly early-career scientists. We have diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of us have grown up in poverty.
We aspire for synergy with journalists, policy makers, and other stakeholders. Feel free to reach out!

# A balanced view

The discourse often casts people in poverty in a negative light. It uses language of deficit and impairment (e.g., when describing lower test scores, on average) and emphasizes undesirable decision making (e.g., when individuals favor present over future reward). However:

 1. People also develop unique knowledge, perspectives, values, strengths, and strategies. For instance, they might be more attuned to other peopleâ€™s thoughts and feelings.

 2. People may show lower performance for reasons other than impaired ability. For instance, making learning and testing materials more relevant can help or hinder performance.
 
3. People make decisions that can be understood as a response to their environment. For instance, they might invest less in future rewards if these are unlikely to materialize.
