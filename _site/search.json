    "text": "A balanced view\nThe discourse often casts people in poverty in a negative light. It uses language of deficit and impairment (e.g., when describing lower test scores, on average) and emphasizes undesirable decision making (e.g., when individuals favor present over future reward). However:\n\nPeople also develop unique knowledge, perspectives, values, strengths, and strategies. For instance, they might be more attuned to other people’s thoughts and feelings.\nPeople may show lower performance for reasons other than impaired ability. For instance, making learning and testing materials more relevant can help or hinder performance.\nPeople make decisions that can be understood as a response to their environment. For instance, they might invest less in future rewards if these are unlikely to materialize.\n\n\n\nProducts\nOur products offer a broad, humanistic view on people in poverty. We make infographics, fact sheets, animations, and scientific articles. For an overview, please go here."

    "text": "Meriah DeJoseph\nMeriah’s research investigates how experiences related to poverty, and the timing of these experiences, shape children’s learning and how they regulate their behavior and physiological responses across development. A key focus is understanding how these experiences provide children with tools to adapt to their unique situations, even when such adaptations may come at a cost. Meriah adopts a strength-based approach to her work, exploring the assets that children, their families, and communities develop in the face of adversity. To ensure the accuracy of my findings, she employs research methods and measures sensitive to both sociocultural and developmental nuances. These methods aid in deriving conclusions about the specific aspects of poverty that impact different groups, the reasons behind these impacts, and the varied contexts in which they manifest. Collectively, Meriah’s work strives to amplify the voices and needs of economically marginalized children, guiding the creation of social and educational policies that promote their thriving.\nMeriah DeJoseph is a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University.\nKeywords: Child poverty, adaptive self-regulation, socioculturally-valid measuring, strengt-based approach"
