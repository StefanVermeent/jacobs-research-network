    "text": "In the public domain, people who belong to systematically disadvantaged groups are often cast in a negative light. The discourse uses the language of deficit (e.g., ‘impaired’ cognition) and emphasizes (what are thought to be) flawed decisions (e.g., an ‘inability’ to delay gratification). This way, people are themselves blamed for the inequities they face. However:\n\nDisparities between people from systematically advantaged and disadvantaged groups may often be the result of factors other than impaired ability. For instance, making learning and testing materials more relevant can help or hinder performance.\nPeople also develop unique knowledge, perspectives, values, strengths, and strategies as a result of their lived experiences associated with their identity and background. For instance, they might be more attuned to other people’s thoughts and feelings.\nPeople make decisions that can be understood as a response to their environment. For instance, they might invest less in future rewards if these are unlikely to materialize."

    "text": "We aim to improve science communication about people who experience social, economic, and other forms of adversity. Our goal is to adopt a humanizing and holistic approach that recognizes and highlights the unique knowledge and strengths of people who are systematically disadvantaged in our societies.\nWe are a group of scientists across the world at different career stages who come from diverse backgrounds and hold unique identities.We are a group of mainly early-career scientists. We have diverse backgrounds and identities.\nWe aspire for synergy with anyone who shares our mission, including journalists, policy makers, and other stakeholders.
