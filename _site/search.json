    "text": "A balanced view\nThe discourse often casts people in poverty in a negative light. It uses language of deficit and impairment (e.g., when describing lower test scores, on average) and emphasizes undesirable decision making (e.g., when individuals favor present over future reward). However:\n\nPeople also develop unique knowledge, perspectives, values, strengths, and strategies. For instance, they might be more attuned to other peopleâ€™s thoughts and feelings.\nPeople may show lower performance for reasons other than impaired ability. For instance, making learning and testing materials more relevant can help or hinder performance.\nPeople make decisions that can be understood as a response to their environment. For instance, they might invest less in future rewards if these are unlikely to materialize.\n\n\n\nProducts\nOur products offer a broad, humanistic view on people in poverty. We make infographics, fact sheets, animations, and scientific articles. For an overview, please go here."
